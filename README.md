*****IMPORTANT*****
DO NOT CLOSE OUT OF THE APPLICATION USING THE RED X AT THE TOP OF THE WINDOW. 
TO CLOSE THE APPLICATION PRESS 'LOG OUT'

The reason for this is the text files are only encrypted when the user presses 'Log Out'
Therefore, if a user presses the red x the files aren't encrypted and when the application
opens the next time, the system attempts to decrypt non-encrypted files and gives an error.
